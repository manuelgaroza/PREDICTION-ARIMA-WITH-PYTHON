# PREDICTION-ARIMA

**ARIMA**, short for â€˜AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Averageâ€™, is a forecasting algorithm based on the idea that the information in the past values of the time series 
can alone be used to predict the future values.
Any â€˜non-seasonalâ€™ time series that exhibits patterns and is not a random white noise can be modeled with ARIMA models.

We make a ARIMA forecast of the avocado prices in Spain.


## Pre requirements ðŸ“‹


For this project, we need the following python libraries:
  Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodelapi, matplotlib, pmdarima, datetime

And I use the data "C:/Users/manut/Downloads/AGUAC.csv"
